# Temporado Travel App

This Travel App is a demo/concept app that allows you to search for different vacation listings in different places around the world. The frontend of the app is built with React and React Router. I used TailwindCSS for clean and consistent styles and to speed up the dev process. I used Express.js/Node.js, MongoDB, and NGINX hosted on a Linux VPS for the backend of the app. The different properties listed in the app are pulled from sample AirBNB data stored using MongoDB.

The backend code for the app can be found on [this](https://github.com/blake-hodges/travel-app-backend) github repo.
